# Student Depression Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing mental health and depression among students using machine learning and deep learning models. It provides a fully interactive and visual dashboard that allows users to explore insights, visualize results, and make predictions based on a given dataset.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `models/`: Trained ML/DL models
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model building
- `dashboard/`: Interactive dashboard UI and logic (Streamlit or similar)
- `README.md`: Overview and documentation of the project

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Understand student mental health trends
- Predict likelihood of depression based on key indicators
- Visualize relationships among features and their impact on mental health
- Provide decision support to institutions and psychologists

## üß† Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)
- AutoML (TPOT or LightAutoML)

Each model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. The best-performing models were selected for integration into the dashboard.
